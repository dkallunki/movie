*******  Project  Movie  Following a tutorial on Lynda.com for C++ ************


MS Visual Studio/win 7
Main.cpp met the solution requirements.
The user can add 3 movies, the movie title the year and the rating. 
This shows basic class usage, I learned I could place the year 
validation right in the constructor, as opposed to calling a method. 

Instantly, I disliked the solution and wrote Main2.cpp.
Main2.cpp I used simple struct and cleaned up the code. 
Realizing the limitations I wanted to improve again. 
The next program needs to allow many movies to be entered, I would 
like the user to be able to set the number, sort, add, delete items,
and display. Not done yet.

goal: learn github with a colaberator, push/pull and edit files.

Main3.cpp: The program works version 5, and I will be working on the next version.

max number of movies 1000
use linked lists
use text files
allow, update, eidt, delete, and display in alphabetical order.
trying different sorts.
